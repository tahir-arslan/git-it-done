# Git It Done

In this lesson, we explore the differences between client-side API's and server-side API's. This is done by becoming familiar with fetch API to send requests to a server-side API, in this case GitHub's API. 

Data received is parsed into a JSON format, and used to dynamically generate HTML based on user input. Asynchornous javascript is also introduced

Response codes are also introduced, along with metadata such as headers, status, and URL's.
