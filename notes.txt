            response.json()
            // this .json() returns another promise, therefore the next .then() method is required

status codes:
    in the 200s means HTTP request was successful
    in the 400s means HTTP request received but issue with how the request was made
        ex. missing info, user/page that does not exist, etc
    in the 500s means error with server or lack of internet connection to make request

when testing for connection errors, can either disconnect internet or put in wrong URL (correct afterwards)

Fetch API is created around javascript promise
